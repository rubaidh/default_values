DefaultValues
=============

default_values is a rails plugin that allows you to easily set the default values for new objects in memory without tampering with initialize in the model yourself.

Tested to work with Rails 2.3.2


Example
=======

You have a model with an attribute name:

class Biscuit < ActiveRecord::Base
  default_values  :name => "foo"
end

You can also pass blocks to the attribute:

class Biscuit < ActiveRecord::Base
  default_values  :name => lambda { rand(10) }
end
